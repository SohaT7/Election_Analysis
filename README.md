# Election Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
[PyPoll_Challenge.py](https://github.com/SohaT7/Election_Analysis/blob/main/PyPoll_Challenge.py) contains this analysis.

## Election Audit Summary
This code script can be used by the election commission, with some modifications to suit specific election processes, for any election. The vote counts for not only counties, but cities and more importantly, states, can be generated too. If the candidates belong to various parties, all candidates belonging to each of those parties can be aggregated as well. The code can also be modified to calculate the total votes for all candidates belonging to a certain party in a certain state. Whichever way the code is modified, it will add to the nuances in the story these numbers can tell us.
